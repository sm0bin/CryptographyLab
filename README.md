# Cryptographic Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Cryptographic Algorithms Repository! This repository contains Python code implementations of various cryptographic algorithms for educational and reference purposes. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script for clarity and ease of understanding. If you find this helpful don't forget to give it a star.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Caesar Cipher (caesar-cipher.py):** This script implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

2. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ecc.py):** This script provides an implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), a public key cryptography method based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.

3. **Hill Cipher (hill-cipher.py):** The Hill Cipher script implements a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, which encrypts and decrypts blocks of text.

4. **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher (monoalphabetic-substitution-cipher.py):** This script demonstrates the Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with another letter consistently throughout the message.

5. **Playfair Cipher (playfair-cipher.py):** The Playfair Cipher script implements a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters, providing stronger encryption than simple substitution ciphers.

6. **RSA (rsa.py):** This script implements the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm, a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure communication.

7. **S-DES Key Generation (sdes-key-generation.py):** S-DES (Simplified Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts and decrypts data. This script generates the necessary keys for S-DES encryption.

8. **Vigen√®re Cipher (vigenere-cipher-l.py & vigenere-cipher-2.py):** These scripts provide implementations of the Vigen√®re Cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword and multiple alphabets.

## Usage

Each Python script can be run independently to demonstrate the respective cryptographic algorithm. Simply execute the script in a Python environment, and follow the instructions provided within the script or through command-line arguments to encrypt or decrypt messages.

## Disclaimer

These implementations are primarily for educational purposes and may not be optimized for production-level security. They are intended to provide insights into how various cryptographic algorithms work and should not be used for handling sensitive data without proper review and testing.
